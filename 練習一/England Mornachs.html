    <h1 class="title">Kings and Queens</h1>
    <p>This list of kings and queens of the Kingdom of England begins with Alfred the Great,<br> 
       who initially ruled Wessex, one of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms which later made up<br> 
       modern England. Alfred styled himself King of the Anglo-Saxons from about 886, and while<br> 
       he was not the first king to claim to rule all of the English, his rule represents the<br> 
       start of the first unbroken line of kings to rule the whole of England, the House of Wessex.</p>
